UEs spike/drop suggests a sudden change in user load or network congestion.\n- Recommended fix: For Low RSRP, consider modifying antenna azimuth/downtilt to redistribute traffic. For UEs spike/drop, use Load Balancing Features (e.g., A3/A5 offset tuning for HO) and tune Cell Individual Offsets (CIO) for better distribution.

Cell ID 66, Band 71  \n- Low RSRP: -116.5 dBm \u003C -110 dBm\n- Explanation: Low RSRP typically indicates poor signal strength, which can be due to distance from the cell, physical obstructions, or interference from other cells. This can lead to reduced data rates, dropped calls, and decreased overall network performance.\n- Recommended fix: Refer to Baicells documentation (Section 7.2.1, Page 46) for configuring intra-frequency measurements, which may help in optimizing RSRP by adjusting parameters like RSRP offset, thresholds, and measurement consolidation.\n\nCell ID 66, Band Band 66 (FORMAT ERROR):\nLLM_FORMAT_ERROR: Python detected anomalies: Throughput Drop: 17.40 Mbps (Current) vs. 58.82 Mbps (Avg Prior 3) - drop \u003E 50%.

Throughput drop, in conjunction with low RSRP, suggests that the poor radio conditions are impacting network performance, potentially causing users to experience slower data speeds.\n- Recommended fix: Remediation: Modify antenna azimuth/downtilt to redistribute traffic.\n\nCell ID 68, Band Band 26:\nANOMALY_DETECTED  \n1. Cell ID 68, Band 26  \n- Low RSRP: -118.1 dBm \u003C -110 dBm\n- Explanation: Low RSRP typically indicates poor signal strength, often due to distance from the cell, physical obstructions, or interference. This can lead to communication disruptions, dropped calls, and slow data speeds.  \n- Recommended fix: Refer to Baicells documentation (Section 7.2.1 IntraFREQ Measurement List, Page 46) for adjusting IntraFREQ Measurement parameters like RSRP thresholds and offsets to optimize signal strength.\n\nCell ID 68, Band Band 66:\nANOMALY_DETECTED  \n1.

Cell ID 70, Band 29  \n- Low RSRP: -116.38 dBm \u003C -110 dBm\n- Explanation: Low RSRP typically indicates poor radio conditions, often caused by physical obstructions, distance from the cell site, or interference from other sources. This can lead to reduced network performance, lower throughput, and decreased user experience.\n- Recommended fix: Remediation: Modify antenna azimuth/downtilt to redistribute traffic.\n\nCell ID 71, Band Band 29:\nANOMALY_DETECTED  \n1.

Throughput drop often relates to network or data issues, which could be caused by various factors including high interference, resource overload, or misconfiguration.\n- Recommended fix: \nFor Low RSRP, consider modifying antenna azimuth/downtilt to redistribute traffic or tune Cell Individual Offsets (CIO) for better distribution (Refer to Baicells documentation, Section 7, Remediation).\n\nCell ID 73, Band Band 71:\nANOMALY_DETECTED  \n1. Cell ID 73, Band 71  \n- Low RSRP: -118.93 dBm \u003C -110 dBm\n- Explanation: Low RSRP typically indicates poor radio conditions, often caused by physical obstructions, distance from the cell site, or interference from other sources. This can lead to reduced network performance, lower throughput, and increased handovers or call drops.\n- Recommended fix: Refer to Baicells documentation (Section 7, Remediation: Modify antenna azimuth/downtilt to redistribute traffic.)\n\nCell ID 74, Band Band 29:\nANOMALY_DETECTED  \n1. Cell ID 74, Band 29  \n- Low RSRP: -118.92 dBm \u003C -110 dBm\n- Explanation: Low RSRP typically indicates poor radio conditions, often caused by physical obstructions, distance from the cell site, or interference from other cells or external sources. This can lead to reduced throughput, increased retransmissions, and decreased overall network performance.\n- Recommended fix: Refer to Baicells documentation (Section 7, Remediation: Modify antenna azimuth/downtilt to redistribute traffic.)\n\nCell ID 74, Band Band 26:\nANOMALY_DETECTED  \n1. Cell ID 74, Band 26  \n- Low RSRP: -112.53 dBm \u003C -110 dBm\n- Explanation: Low RSRP typically indicates bad radio conditions, possibly due to distance from the cell site, physical obstructions, or interference from other cells.  \n- Recommended fix: Refer to Baicells documentation (Section 7, Remediation for Low RSRP or similar issues, specifically \"Modify antenna azimuth/downtilt to redistribute traffic.\")\n\nCell ID 76, Band Band 71:\nANOMALY_DETECTED  \n1.

Throughput drop often relates to network congestion, misconfiguration, or issues with neighboring cells.  \n- Recommended fix: Remediation: Modify antenna azimuth/downtilt to redistribute traffic. Use Load Balancing Features (e.g., A3/A5 offset tuning for HO). Tune Cell Individual Offsets (CIO) for better distribution.
